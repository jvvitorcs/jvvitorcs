Hi, I'm Jo√£o Vitor Correia. I develop games since college (2015 - 2018). I graduated college for Digital Games in UNICAP and I'm studying graduate course in Agile Tests at C.E.S.A.R. My main focuses are programming and testing.

I've been involved in friends' personal projects and Game Jams such as GameJam+ and Global Game Jam.

In addition, I have taught programming in a technology school for children and I develop content in the games area, also for a technology school.
