My name is Jo√£o Vitor Correia, and I am a game developer with a solid academic background and practical experience in the field. I earned my degree in Digital Games from UNICAP in 2018, and subsequently specialized in Agile Testing at C.E.S.A.R, graduating in 2022.

With a primary focus on programming and testing, I have been actively involved in various projects over the years, from collaborations on friends' personal projects to competitions such as GameJam+ and Global Game Jam.

My last job was at the company SIDIA, where I served as a QA Tester. In this role, I applied my testing expertise to ensure the quality and integrity of the software products developed by the company.

Additionally, I have significant experience in teaching programming, having taught classes at a technology school for children. My involvement in content creation in the gaming area also extends to another technology course I was involved with.
