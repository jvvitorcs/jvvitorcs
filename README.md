Hi, I'm Jo√£o Vitor Correia. I develop games since college (2015 - 2018). I graduated college for Digital Games in UNICAP and post-graduated in Agile Tests at C.E.S.A.R (2022). My main focuses are programming and testing.

I've been involved in friends' personal projects and Game Jams such as GameJam+ and Global Game Jam.

In addition, I have taught programming in a technology school for children and I develop content in the games area, also for a technology school.
